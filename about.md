title:  "About this blog"
---

*Metaengineering* is a blog, accompanied by a regular virtual seminar series, that is, broadly speaking, about combining computers and computationally complex physical systems (i.e., physical systems that take a lot of effort to simulate on a computer). The founding idea behind Metaengineering is that our evolving relationship with computers should co-evolve how we do science and engineering with physical systems that are complex, i.e., systems that are things like nonlinear, involve many continuous degrees-of-freedom, quantum mechanical, are far from equilibrium, etc. Our hope is that one day we'll be able to program the functionality and form of a diverse family of complex, analog physical systems with as much precision, complexity, ease, and creativity as we currently program digital computers.
The main contributors of this blog have our own biases - we come from backgrounds in **nonlinear optics**, **quantum optics**, **laser physics**, etc. Hence, in practice Metaengineering approaches this broader topic by simultaneously addressing an evolving list of specific, related topics. These include:

- Theory, experiments, and applications of multimode nonlinear and quantum optics in particular. We see this as an ideal "model system" for complex physical systems more generally, and as a platform with an exciting range of potential applications in measurement & information processing.
- Programmable physical systems
- Computing, learning, and computational sensing with complex physical systems

The name "Metaengineering" comes from Hideo Mabuchi, whose lab at Stanford University we have previously been affiliated. While there is a good argument to be made that this name sounds very grandiose and is vastly too broad to describe this blog's scope, we like that it reminds us of our academic duty to not only innovate and advance engineering science, but to also be thoughtful and innovative in the practice of that. It also keeps the door open for exploration, opportunity and inclusivity. And, frankly it sounds pretty cool.

A key feature of Metaengineering is our regular virtual seminar and discussion, which happens weekly. We try to alternate between the three topics above. The schedule is here, and if you'd like to give or suggest a talk, please reach out here. Note that we ask for a particular format which may require a little different preparation than a standard seminar talk, and we'll likely ask you some questions that may push you out of your comfort zone.
