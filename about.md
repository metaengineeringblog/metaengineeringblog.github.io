title:  "What is Metaengineering"
---
*Metaengineering* is a blog that is, broadly speaking, about combining computers and computationally complex physical systems (i.e., physical systems that take a lot of effort to simulate on a computer). The founding idea behind Metaengineering is that our evolving relationship with computers should co-evolve how we do science and engineering with physical systems that are complex, i.e., systems that are things like nonlinear, involve many continuous degrees-of-freedom, quantum mechanical, are far from equilibrium, etc. Our hope is that one day we'll have a *physical* computer science - a discipline and infrastructure that lets us program the functionality and form of diverse complex, analog physical systems with as much precision, complexity, ease, and creativity as we currently program digital electronic computers.The main contributors of this blog have biases - we come from backgrounds in nonlinear optics, quantum optics, laser physics, etc. Hence, in practice Metaengineering approaches this broader topic by simultaneously addressing an evolving list of specific, related topics. These include:

1. Programmable physical systems (with a bias towards photonics)
2. Computing, learning, and computational sensing with complex physical systems (again, with a bias)
3. Theory, experiments, and applications of multimode nonlinear and quantum optics. We see this as an ideal "model system" for complex physical systems more generally, and as a platform with an exciting range of potential applications in measurement & information processing.

The name "Metaengineering" comes from Hideo Mabuchi, whose lab at Stanford University we have previously been affiliated. While there is a good argument to be made that this name sounds too grandiose and is vastly too broad to describe this blog's scope, we like that it reminds us of our academic duty to not only innovate and advance engineering science, but to also be thoughtful, introspective, innovative, and educational in that practice. It also keeps the door open for exploration, opportunity and inclusivity. And, frankly, it sounds pretty cool.Why is Metaengineering?In short, we think a blog can play a useful, complementary role in the research process, and within the human enterprise of scientific research.

1. Blogs can play a complementary role in the scientific process compared to traditional articles. Traditional scientific articles are mostly hard, painstakingly sculpted blocks of content, bricks from which science is supposed to be incrementally constructed. Blogs are more fluid, allowing for softer phases of scientific content that can help to, as needed, slowly erode or glue together blocks of solid science. Blogs can be more accessible than traditional scientific outputs, and can touch on many meta-aspects of research that most scientific article formats don't lend themselves to. Blogs can be fun too - and fun seems to matter far more than it gets credit for when it comes to creative, boundary-pushing science and innovation.

2. A blog can similarly supplement traditional forms of scientific community. Just like it doesn't replace traditional articles, a blog won't replace in-person conferences or collaborations. But a blog is at least one way to have a communal dialogue that doesn't require spending thousands of dollars and weeks at a time in planes or cars, and consequently, it can involve a wider, or different set of voices and ideas.

Who is Metaengineering? Metaengineering is a collaboration between:

1. Logan Wright, an assistant professor of applied physics at Yale University
2. Tatsuhiro (Hiro) Onodera, a research scientist at NTT Research, Inc. and visiting scientist at Cornell University
