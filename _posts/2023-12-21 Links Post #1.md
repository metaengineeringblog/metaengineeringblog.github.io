# Links #1

By Logan Wright & Tatsuhiro Onodera

Ripping off a common post on blogs we like, this is a collection of barely-curated interesting links we've come across over the last couple months that are related (perhaps tangentially) to physical computing, physical intelligence, or multimode photonics.

**Physical computing(ish)**

[Tangle worms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEv23nApEog) are worms that work together to create a really enthralling collective "smart fluid", a gross, icky flock. These are not microscopic worms, but it's still somewhat tempting as a physicist to imagine describing this as a sort of smart, active material based on the relatively simple behaviors of individual worms.  

I spent some time in preparing my course this semester looking for good examples of documented code-based tutorials. Often Jupyter is the format for these, but excitingly the rules are getting few and far between for interactive technical communication. 

To me, the original GOAT of this is [Paul Falstad](https://www.falstad.com) Paul Falstad, especially his [circuit simulator](https://www.falstad.com/circuit/circuitjs.html) that I played like a psychedelic video game as a child. 

More recently, my mind has been blown by [VisualPDE](https://visualpde.com/) Nonlinear PDEs are captivating and beautiful - credit to the Visual PDE for capturing that so well, in visualizations that frequently cross over into art. Pairs well with psychedelic music. 

Following the Jupyter-ish format, a few standout examples:
[Jake's Triple Pendulum CHAOS](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2017/03/08/triple-pendulum-chaos/)(Also just a wonderful journey into how the world gets so much more complex the instant you get outside of cleverly designed textbook problems and toy models)

[Raj's Ising model tutorial](https://rajeshrinet.github.io/blog/2014/ising-model/) introduces the Ising model with enviable straightforwardness. Top-tier code overview. 

**Multimode optics (ish)**

Remember that one problem in your first quantum course with a delta-function potential? That same logic allows a single atomic-layer material to be used as a pretty nifty waveguide, potentially capitalizing on the many cool properties of such materials. Exciting stuff will probably need to wait until larger areas are possible. 
[See in Science magazine](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adi2322)

There was a whole Nobel prize for optics recently, for attosecond pulses. I enjoyed [Spencer Jolly's take on the prize](http://www.ponderomotive.com/blog/?p=172). 

**Other**

[Ideophone](https://ideophone.org/mindblowing-dissertations/) describes a handful of unconventional dissertations. It's tempting to look at these as tragic - so much effort, quality and intellectual depth into something that has, realistically, a microscopic audience. But I actually see these as exemplifying something I really love about academic research (even in practice!): this is a creative pursuit where originality is appreciated. Experimenting with form, format, style, and purpose is part of the broader intellectual journey of research.
