Physical systems naturally perform complex transformation on input data. This can be summarized mathematically via a physical map as follows: 

$$y = f_{\text{physical}}(x)$$ 

Noting that neural networks themselves are just functions of input data, we see that the transformations of physical systems can be naturally leveraged for computation!
